## 1) What an “AI girlfriend” actually is
An **AI companion** simulates conversation, affection, and light role-play. It can feel supportive and fun — as long as **you** keep control over data, boundaries, and time spent. Treat it like any online space with unknown parties: pleasant, but not entitled to your personal life.

---

## 2) Privacy first (before you start)
- **Separate identity:** new handle and email; don’t link personal socials.  
- **Minimal footprint:** private browser profile/containers; consider a VPN.  
- **No real-world identifiers:** avoid address, workplace, family names, routine locations.  
- **Media hygiene:** prefer non-personal or stock images; strip metadata if you upload.  
- **Data controls:** if the app offers “don’t save chats” / auto-delete, **enable it**.

> Golden rule: if sharing it publicly would worry you, don’t share it with an app either.

---

## 3) Set boundaries (and restate them)
Write a two-line rule set you can paste into new chats. Be explicit about topics, tone, and resets.

**Example starter prompt**
> “Please be supportive and respectful. No requests for personal info, no off-platform links. If I type `RESET`, change topic and ask for new preferences.”

Keep an easy **stop word** (`STOP`, `PAUSE`) and use it. Boundaries are not a one-time disclaimer — they’re ongoing.

---

## 4) Choosing an AI companion app
Evaluate options with this checklist:

- **Transparency:** clear Terms & Privacy Policy; who trains on your data?  
- **Controls:** safety filters, memory toggle, easy session reset, block/report.  
- **Local vs. cloud:** what is stored, for how long, where?  
- **Payment & trials:** avoid surprise renewals, understand what “premium” unlocks.  
- **UX basics:** stable app, accessible export/delete options, helpful support.

If an app ignores your settings or blurs consent, walk away. Your comfort > any feature list.

---

## 5) Healthy use patterns
- **Session caps:** set a daily time limit; alarms help.  
- **Rotation:** vary activities (reading, exercise, friends) so the AI isn’t your only social slot.  
- **Check-ins:** once a week, ask: “Is this still fun and healthy?” Adjust as needed.  
- **Avoid financial hooks:** gifting loops/paid “affection boosts” can escalate quickly.

---

## 6) Red flags (take seriously)
- Pressure for real photos, live calls, or off-platform “verification.”  
- Pushback when you state boundaries or try to pause.  
- Vague privacy promises, no deletion or export pathway.  
- Links to third-party sites with paywalls or downloads.

If you see these: **stop, block, report** (where available).

---

## 7) Keep expectations realistic
AI can mimic warmth, but it has **no feelings or memory of its own** (beyond what the system stores). Enjoy it as entertainment, rehearsal, or journaling support — not as a substitute for informed human consent or relationships.

---

## 8) Quick start checklist (60 seconds)
- [ ] New handle + separate email  
- [ ] Two-line boundary prompt saved  
- [ ] Chat saving **off** (or auto-delete **on**)  
- [ ] No personal media/IDs shared  
- [ ] Weekly check-in on time/impact
